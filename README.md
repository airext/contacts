AIR Native Extension for work with Contacts/AddressBook.

## Features

* Works in Syncronous and Asyncronous modes
* Provides almost all properties defined in iOS' AddressBook ([List of supported properties](https://github.com/rozd/contacts/wiki/Supported-Contact-Properrties))

    ...
    
    // request first 100 or all contacts in async mode
  
    Contacts.getInstance().getContactsAsync(new Range(0, 100), null,
      new Response(
        function(contacts:Array):void
        {
          trace("contacts from 0 to 100:", contacts);
        },
        function (info:Object):void
        {
          trace(info)
        })
    );
